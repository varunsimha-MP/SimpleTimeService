# DevOps Project — SimpleTimeService

---

## 1. Introduction

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps workflow where I designed, built, and deployed a containerized microservice using Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD pipelines.

The application is a simple API that returns the current timestamp and client IP address in JSON format.

 “The goal was to implement an end-to-end automated deployment pipeline.”

## 2. Prerequisites & Setup (Before Deployment)

Before running this project, some initial setup is required.

Tools Required:
* Terraform
* AWS CLI
* Docker
* Git

“These tools are required to build, deploy, and manage the infrastructure.”

* Docker Setup
* Create DockerHub account
* Ensure image repository is public

"ECS needs public access to pull the Docker image.”


## GitHub Actions Setup (IMPORTANT)
1. Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to:
GitHub → Repository → Settings → Secrets

Add:

* DOCKER_USERNAME
* DOCKER_PASSWORD
* OIDC (IAM Role ARN)
* region

“Secrets are used to securely authenticate without hardcoding credentials.”

 2. AWS IAM Role for OIDC
* Create IAM Role with:
* Trust: GitHub OIDC provider
* Permissions: ECS, ECR (optional), S3, etc.

“This enables secure, password-less authentication from GitHub to AWS.”

3. Enable GitHub Environment (Optional)
* Create environment: dev
* Add approval rules (optional)

“This adds an approval gate before deployment.”

## 3. Application Layer

I built a lightweight microservice using **FastAPI (Python)**.

* Endpoint: `/`
* Output:

  * Current timestamp
  * Client IP

The application is designed to be minimal, stateless, and easy to containerize.

---

## 4. Containerization

The application is packaged using Docker.

Key points:

* Uses a lightweight base image (`python:slim`)
* Runs as a **non-root user** for security
* Exposes port `8080`

The image is pushed to DockerHub and used during deployment.

---

## 5. Infrastructure Design (Terraform)

I provisioned infrastructure using **Terraform with a modular structure**.

### Components created:

* VPC with public and private subnets
* Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
* ECS Fargate Cluster
* Application Load Balancer (ALB)
* Route53 (DNS)
* ACM (SSL certificate)

### DNS Delegation - Route53 (DNS)

After creating the hosted zone, update the domain registrar with the provided NS records:

1. Navigate to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap).
2. Locate the domain’s DNS / Nameserver settings.
3. Replace existing nameservers with the NS records from the hosted zone.
4. Save changes and allow time for DNS propagation.

># Note: Without this step, the domain will not resolve to the infrastructure provisioned in the hosted zone it will be stuck the infrastructure provision.

Infrastructure is fully defined using Terraform for repeatability.
---

## 6. Security Architecture

Security was a key design focus:

* ECS runs in **private subnets only**
* No direct internet access to containers
* ALB acts as the only entry point
* Security Groups allow traffic:

  * Internet → ALB
  * ALB → ECS (only)

“This ensures the application is not directly exposed to the internet.”

---

## 7. Terraform State Management

Terraform state is stored remotely in **S3 backend**.

* S3 bucket stores the state file
* Locking mechanism prevents concurrent updates

This ensures:

* Safe collaboration
* Consistent infrastructure state
* No accidental overwrites

---

## 8. Deployment Approaches

The project supports two deployment methods:

---

# 8A. Manual Deployment

This is used for:

* Initial setup
* Debugging
* Understanding flow

### Steps:

1. Build Docker image
2. Push to DockerHub
3. Run Terraform apply
4. Access application via ALB

### Updating application manually:

* Build and push new image
* Trigger ECS deployment using:

```
aws ecs update-service --force-new-deployment
```

---

# 8B. Automated Deployment (CI/CD)

This is the **primary deployment method**.

---

## 🔹 CI Pipeline (Build & Push)

### Trigger:

* Runs on code push

### Steps:

1. Build Docker image
2. Tag image as `latest`
3. Push image to DockerHub

---

## 🔹 CD Pipeline (Deploy)

### Trigger:

* Automatically triggered after CI completes

### Steps:

1. Authenticate to AWS using OIDC
2. Trigger ECS deployment using:

```
aws ecs update-service --force-new-deployment
```

---

## What happens during deployment?

* ECS pulls latest image
* Starts new containers
* Gradually replaces old containers
* Ensures no downtime

---

## 9. Rolling Deployment Strategy

The ECS service is configured with:

* Minimum healthy: 50%
* Maximum capacity: 200%
* Forced deployment enabled

This ensures:

* Zero downtime
* High availability
* Smooth upgrades

---

## 10. End-to-End Flow

```
User → Route53 → ALB → ECS → Container

 “Traffic flows through ALB into private ECS tasks.”
```

---

## 11. Complete Automation Flow

```
Developer pushes code
   ↓
CI builds Docker image
   ↓
Image pushed to DockerHub
   ↓
CD triggers ECS deployment
   ↓
Rolling update happens
   ↓
Application updated with zero downtime
```

---

## 12.  Key Design Decisions

* Terraform for reproducible infrastructure
* ECS Fargate to avoid server management
* Private subnets for security
* ALB for controlled access
* CI/CD separation for faster deployments
* S3 backend for reliable state management with locking enabled

---

## 13.  Final Outcome

This project delivers:

* Fully automated infrastructure
* Secure cloud architecture
* Zero-downtime deployments
* Clear separation of infrastructure and application lifecycle

---

## 14.  Cleanup

To avoid AWS charges:

```
terraform destroy -var-file="dev-environment.tfvars"
```

---

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates a production-style DevOps workflow with automation, scalability, and security best practices.
